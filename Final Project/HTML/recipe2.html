        This recipe makes perfect fluffy pancakes with just a few simple
        ingredients. They are sure to be a family favorite, and kids will love
        helping make their breakfast. Flavorful and light, these pancakes are
        cheaper to make than buying a pre-made mix and don't have any hidden
        preservatives and stabilizers—plus, homemade tastes so much better.
        They're so quick and easy, you'll never reach for the pancake mix again.
        <br />
        <br />
        For perfect pancakes from scratch, make sure to measure your flour
        properly and check that your baking powder is not stale; old baking
        powder won't rise as much, yielding heavy and rather dense pancakes.
        Don't over-mix your batter (there should still be some lumps) and let it
        sit for at least 10 minutes before cooking. Look for the telltale signs
        before you flip—the edges should be starting to set up and with bubbles
        appearing throughout.

        This recipe uses basic ingredients for pancakes that are delicious on
        their own but also fun to customize. Try some different toppings like
        fruit syrups, compote, or even chocolate sauce. Drop a few wild
        blueberries in the batter before flipping your pancakes for a fruity
        variation. For a filling breakfast spread, serve with bacon, sausage,
        and scrambled or fried eggs.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <hr class="underline2" />
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed berries, optional</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, to taste, optional</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps to Make It</h2>
      <hr class="underline2" />
    
      <ol start="1.">
        <li>
          Gather the ingredients. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Sift or whisk together the flour and baking powder in a large mixing bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
          In a separate bowl, beat the eggs thoroughly. Stir in the milk, sugar, and salt and mix until the sugar is dissolved. Stir in the vanilla.
        </li>

        <li>
          Add the wet ingredients to the dry and use a fork to gently and thoroughly combine all of the ingredients. Make sure not to overmix—you'll still see some lumps. Gently break up some of the bigger lumps with your fork, but don't mix for much longer than 20 seconds.
        </li>

        <li>
          Allow the batter to rest for 10 to 20 minutes. If making bigger batches of pancakes, preheat the oven to 170 F to keep finished pancakes warm while you cook the rest of the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat your griddle to 375 F or heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat.
        </li>

        <li>
          Once your cooking surface is hot, lightly spray it with cooking spray.
        </li>

        <li>
          For each pancake, ladle 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle or pan. Cook until the tops of the pancakes are full of bubbles, the edges are set, and the bottoms are golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flip the pancakes and cook until cooked through and beginning to brown on the bottom, about 1 minute more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Either serve right away or transfer to the oven to keep warm. To serve, top with the optional butter, fruit, and maple syrup, or your choice of toppings.
          </li>
      </ol>
